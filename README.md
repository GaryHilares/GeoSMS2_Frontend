## What is GeoSMS2 Frontend?
GeoSMS2 Frontend is a mobile application which acts as frontend for the backend of the GeoSMS2 project. It connects the SMS that any users send to the mobile running the application with [GeoSMS2 Backend](https://github.com/GaryHilares/GeoSMS2_Backend/).

Be careful if you run the software without fully understanding what it does. Otherwise you may unintendedly send SMS to other people.

## Motivation
We want to help people in some Andean areas of Peru, who don't have access to the Internet, to access useful, if limited, Internet-like functionality through SMS.

## Installation and usage
To setup a development environment for the application, you can follow the next steps:
1. Install Android Studio:
    - The Android Studio documentation explains the installation process [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).
2. Build the project:
    1. Open the GeoSMS2 folder in Android studio.
    2. Configure the Android Studio's VM if you haven't already done it, or setup a mobile device for debugging.
    3. Use Android Studio's button to build and run the project in your VM/device.

For a production environment, build and export an APK using Android Studio. Then install it on your mobile device.
